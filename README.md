If there is something that delights me is beautiful graphs telling complete stories. Yes, the famous <b>storytelling</b> is one of my life goals. So, I started my journey to be a good storyteller using, at this time, Tableau and Microsoft Power BI.

    I have planned to do the [Data Visualization Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-visualization) from University of California: a specialization with 5 courses focused on how to create a storytelling with Tableau software. The table below shows my progress until now.

    I have to say that my progress on Power BI is running a little bit slower than my progress on Tableau. Meanwhile, I have some good references to share:
