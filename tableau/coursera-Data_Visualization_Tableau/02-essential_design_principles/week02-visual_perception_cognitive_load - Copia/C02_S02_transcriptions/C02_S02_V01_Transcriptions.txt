[MUSIC] Hey, everyone, and welcome to this module
on Visual Perceptions and Cognitive Load. In the last module, we identified some of
the commonly used types of visualizations. We also discussed the role of ethics and
how it plays in data visualization. And we examined ineffective visualizations
and learned how to improve them. But there is more to the story. As Hunter alluded to earlier, humans
have a built-in system to allow them to visually decipher
the world around them. This module is about how to
apply visual perception and the cognitive load to
the visuals you create. But don't worry, I'm not going to dive too
deep into these things, as Hunter will explain how you design for understanding
in the last module of this course. For this module, we will define
the ideas of cognitive load and clutter. Illustrate the principles
of visual perception. How to strategically use
contrast in your visualizations. Define and
learn how to use pre-attentive attributes. And learn to declutter your visualization. We have a lot to cover,
so let's get started.
