[MUSIC] Hello, everyone, and
welcome to this module. We're going to discuss effective and
ineffective visuals. Up to this point,
we have been able to play with data, but how do we know we are choosing
the right visualization? One of the challenges with doing
visualizations is actually being able to decide what is the best visualization
for the type of data that you have. Some visuals are better for
certain types of data than others. Knowing the intent or
purpose of a particular visual and its advantages and disadvantages
will help inform your decision. Upon completing this module,
you will be able to identify the types of visualizations that
are available in Tableau, and we'll go through some examples. We'll also discuss the role ethics
plays in developing a visualization. And trust me when I say, you want to act ethically while
applying sound design principles. We'll also examine
an ineffective visualization and figure out how best to improve it. Okay, we're all set, so let's get started. [MUSIC]
