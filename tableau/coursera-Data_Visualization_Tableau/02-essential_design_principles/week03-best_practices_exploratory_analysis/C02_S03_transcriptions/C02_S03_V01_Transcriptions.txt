[MUSIC] Welcome back. In this course we have introduced you to
the concepts of visual perception and cognitive load. Essentially, how and why the brain sees
and interprets the world visually. Now we are going to expand
on those concepts and apply them to our data
visualizations within Tableau. Upon completion of this module,
you will be able to leverage and apply Gestalt principles and
pre-attentive attributes in your design. You will be able to identify and
discuss the role that accessibility and aesthetics will play in your design. Along the way I will provide you tips
you can apply to your visualization. Okay, let's go. [MUSIC]
