[MUSIC] Hello, this next set of lessons will have
us taking a step back from the high level of understanding of the theory
of design principles. To actually applying some specific
techniques of exploratory analysis to enhance your skillset with Tableau. Most of this course is intended to guide
you at being good at explanatory analysis. But you can't have good
explanatory analysis without thorough exploratory analysis. So in the first lesson of this mini module
I've asked my colleague Sukh Barrar to help define the difference of the two. He does a great job of making
it easy to understand. Then we will examine a classic
visualization from the 1970s to help provide context as to how
to begin exploring your data. The final two lessons in this mini module
will be using the super store data set. To practice different ways to use
Tableau for exploratory analysis. Specifically, you'll be able to identify
outliers and construct a control chart. Which is a bit challenging, but
it's going to be a lot of fun. Okay, let's get started. [MUSIC]
