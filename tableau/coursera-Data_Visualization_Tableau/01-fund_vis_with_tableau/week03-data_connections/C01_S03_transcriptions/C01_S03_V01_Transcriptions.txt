[MUSIC] Hello, my name is Sut Brar. I will be teaching
the lessons in this module. I have a background in research and
statistics, and I've been in the analytics industry for
over ten years. Throughout the analytics industry,
data visualization has become a very important aspect of
analytics and has been growing rapidly. More recently, software like Tableau has made it much
easier to create data visualizations and has given analysts another very important
tool to use when analyzing data. So what are data connections in
Tableau and why are they important? Data connections allow Tableau
access to your data so you can create beautiful and
interactive dashboards. Making the correct data connections is
very important in Tableau because data can be stored in various types,
like Microsoft Excel, text files, or statistical files or in various locations
such as your computer or on a server. Understanding what type of file stores
your data and where the data is located will dictate what type of data
connection you will need to make. In this module we'll focus on
preparing you data for import and how to connect to different types
of data using Tableau Public. Then, we will distinguish between a live
data connection and a data extract. After that, we'll identify the types of
data that Tableau Public can and cannot connect to and look at the ways to get
around the limitations of Tableau Public. Finally, we'll use Tableau's data source
section to connect to different data sources and merge multiple sources of
data together using common variables. Okay, let's get started.
