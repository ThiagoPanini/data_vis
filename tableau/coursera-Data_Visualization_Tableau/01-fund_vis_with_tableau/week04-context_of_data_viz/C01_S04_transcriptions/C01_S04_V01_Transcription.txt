[MUSIC] Welcome to the fourth and
final module of the course. In this module, we'll take on the who,
what, and how of data visualization. By the end of this module, you will
be able to define the audience and your relationship to the audience, examine ways to define what you're going
to do, for example a visualization, and discuss how you are going to
respond to the who and the what. We will also work through an example
of the who, what, and how. Let's get started.
