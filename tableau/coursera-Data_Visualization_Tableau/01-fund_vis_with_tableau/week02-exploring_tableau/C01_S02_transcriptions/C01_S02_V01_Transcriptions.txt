[MUSIC] Hello and welcome to the second module
which is exploring and navigating Tableau. In the last model I
introduced you to Tableau and you were able to do your
first visualization. In this module I want to really examine
the different tools that Tableau has within their interface. It will make things a lot easier
if you can really identify and memorize what each tool is for as you can
begin to work quicker with your projects. For this module you will navigate the
Tableau Public workspace while doing some visualization. We'll tackle rows,
columns, and mark shelves. In addition, you will use the show
me button to make some quick and dramatic visual changes. So let's get started.
