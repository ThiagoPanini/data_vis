[MUSIC] Hello, and welcome to the first
module in this course. Data visualization is an essential
toolkit to everyone's career. It gives you that edge when
presenting your results. But sometimes it's not intuitive. So, to get us started
in building this skill, we will discuss why we visualize data? And define common terminology. Also, within this module, we will
identify what types of software options are available to do visualizations. You will install the Tableau Public
software on your computer and do your first visualization. I'm so excited to have you join me for
this, so let's get started. [MUSIC]
