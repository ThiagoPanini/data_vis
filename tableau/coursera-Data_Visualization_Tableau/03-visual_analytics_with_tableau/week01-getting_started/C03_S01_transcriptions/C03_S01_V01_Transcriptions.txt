[MUSIC] Hello, and
welcome to Visual Analytics with Tableau. I'm Suk Brar, and
I'll be taking this journey with you. I've been working data visualization for
my entire life, but in Tableau for the last several years. A long time ago, I realized that visuals
are much more impactful than tables, so I began creating effective dashboards
that told the story of the data. My goal for this course is to make you aware of
some of the analytical tools in Tableau. In the first module, I will showcase the
different types of charts in Tableau, and how you can make changes. I will teach you how to overlay
multiple charts onto one another. And you will be able to use
the Tableau Tooltip feature. I will then spend some time going
into each chart type for you, and explain what chart types are better
suited for the type of data you have. In the second module we will spend
some time on dates in Tableau. You will be able to differentiate between
discrete and continuous dates, and use Tableau's date hierarchy feature
to drill down into your timelines. You will also be able to convert
from one date type to another and create date variables
using calculated fields. Table calculations are the topic for
the third module. We will discuss how to create new fields
and make custom table calculations. I will showcase different types
of calculations Tableau provides automatically, and
how each calculation can impact the data. You'll also be able to apply filters and
create parameters effectively. For the final module, we will turn
our attention to mapping in Tableau. You will discover the types of
geographic data recognized by Tableau. And be able to change a map's shapes,
colors, and sizes. You will customize maps to use location
data that is not recognized by Tableau. We will finish our lesson on maps by
overlaying multiple maps known as dual-layer mapping. We have a lot to cover,
so let's get started.
