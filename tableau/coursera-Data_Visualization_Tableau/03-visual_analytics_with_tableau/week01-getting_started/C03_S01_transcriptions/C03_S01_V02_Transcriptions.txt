[MUSIC] Welcome to this first module where
we are going to discuss the topic of charting in Tableau. Tableau is a powerful business
intelligence software that helps people see and understand their data. This module will familiarize you with
a wide range of powerful ways you can use Tableau to translate data
into meaningful insights. For this module,
we will focus on charting. First, we will expand on the various types
of charts that Tableau allows you to use to explore and explain your data and
how to choose a appropriate chart for various situations. Then, you will continue to practice
changing the colors, shapes, and sizes or your chart elements, so you can better
customize your charts to fit your data. After that, we will focus on
creating duel layer charts. This lesson will showcase how to overlay
multiple charts on top of one another. We will also identify the benefits
of duel axis charting. Then, we will cover a great feature
of Tableau known as a Tooltip and its benefits. And in our final set of videos,
we will cover chart guidelines that will help you make choices about when to use
the various charting possibilities. Okay, let's get started. [MUSIC]
