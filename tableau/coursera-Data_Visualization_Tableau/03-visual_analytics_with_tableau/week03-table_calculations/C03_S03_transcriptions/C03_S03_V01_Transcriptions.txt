[MUSIC] Hello there, welcome to this
module on table calculations. Table calculations are computations
that are applied to the values in the entire table and are often
dependent on the table structure itself. Okay, so what does that mean and
why would I use them? Table calculations are calculations
that are performed on data that is already in your table or
chart, so doing additional calculations
on top of previous calculations. So for this module,
you will be able to create new calculated fields to allow you to compare fields,
apply aggregations, and more. Then, you will be able to use
quick table calculations and create new calculated fields. You will also be able to customize
them and apply filters and parameters to your table calculations. We have a lot to cover. So let's get started. [MUSIC]
