[MUSIC] In the last lesson, we focused on what
calculated fields are used for and how to create new fields. In this lesson, I will cover quick table
calculations and show you how to use this calculations to better tell your story. To take the functionality of
calculated fields even further, Tableau allows you to do additional
calculations on your data after Tableau has completed
a query of the data base. Table calculations address
data in the cache table and allow you to perform
calculations on visible results. So, what does that mean? Once our visualization is rendered, we can ask Tableau to literally look
at the results, numbers, bars or plots. And then do math on those visible results. Most importantly, unlike calculated
fields that allow you to compare two or more separate measures in your data set, table calculations allow you to
compare a singular measure to itself. To take the functionality of

superstore dataset and on any worksheet, let's drag
the ship date to the column shelf. And then profit to the rows. Now, if we click on the down
arrow on our profit field and select Quick Table Calculations,
we can see a handful of additional calculations that we can use instead
of using the current SUM function. We can change the sum function
to a running total, difference, percent difference,
percent of total, rank, percentile, moving average,
year to date total, compound growth rate, year over
year growth or year to date growth. To use any of these functions,
simply click on the function you need and Tableau will automatically make
adjustments in the worksheet. For example, if we decide to
use the running total function, we can now see that our target is showing
a running total across all years. After this lesson, you should now
understand what calculated fields are used for, how to create new fields and how to
use Tableau’s quick table calculations. In the next lesson, we will focus on custom table calculations
to analyze your data even further. After this lesson, you should now
