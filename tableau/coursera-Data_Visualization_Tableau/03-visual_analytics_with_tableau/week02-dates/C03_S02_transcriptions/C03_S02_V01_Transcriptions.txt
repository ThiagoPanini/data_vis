[MUSIC] Welcome to the second module where we
are going to highlight dates in Tableau. Understanding what types of dates
Tableau allows you to use, and when to use a specific date
format is very important. Tableau handles discreet and
continuous dates very differently. Understanding how and when to use both
discreet and continuous is very important because each type will make
a huge impact on your analysis. After this module, you will be able
to differentiate between discreet and continuous dates, and when to use each
one to explore and explain your data. You will be able to effectively use date
hierarchies to drill down into your data using the data field. You will also be able to convert
between discrete and continuous dates. And identify why you would want to
switch from one date type to the other. And finally, you will be able to create
dates using calculated fields for those moments when a date
field is not available.
